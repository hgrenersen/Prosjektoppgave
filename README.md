# Prosjektoppgave
Code written and data used for the work with writing my specialization project (TMA4500) at NTNU. 

Scripts containing functions to generate data, implement kriging, different CV (LOO, K-fold and block) estimators and estimating importance weights (Voronoi, KMM & KLIEP) can be found in the folder "Scripts". Scripts that actually generate data, calculate estimates and store these things, are placed in the folder "Estimation".
